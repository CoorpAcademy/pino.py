> In building port of [pinojs](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) logging library to python :snake:

:warning: This is a in building prototype, it's API is subject to change.
A CHANGELOG will be introduced once it's stable enough and publicized.
Use it at you own risk, but feel free to reach with an issue.


## Development :hammer_and_wrench:

This library use [***Pipenv***](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io) for dependencies management.

You can run test on all supported python version with `pipenv run test` (which will run `tox`),
or you can run on your current python version with `pipenv run pytest`.
